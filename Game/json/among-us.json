  "about": "<p>Among Us Mobile is a wildly popular online multiplayer social deduction game developed by Innersloth. It places 4–15 players aboard a spaceship, planetary base, or airship where teammates must work together to complete tasks while identifying the hidden Impostors. The game became a global sensation due to its simple design, intense psychological gameplay, and hilarious communication-based interactions.</p><p>Players take on one of two roles — Crewmates or Impostors. Crewmates must complete their assigned tasks and work as a team, while Impostors blend in, sabotage systems, eliminate players, and manipulate discussions to avoid getting caught. What makes Among Us Mobile so special is its unpredictable gameplay, short rounds, cross-platform support, and constant tension created by not knowing who to trust.</p><p>The mobile version is fully optimized for Android and iOS, offering lightweight performance, smooth touch controls, and seamless online play. Frequent updates introduce new maps, cosmetics, roles, sabotage options, and gameplay mechanics that keep the experience fresh for casual and competitive players.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>Among Us Mobile revolves around teamwork, deception, and strategic communication. Each match randomly assigns players as Crewmates or Impostors. Crewmates must finish tasks, fix sabotages, and observe suspicious behavior. Impostors must create chaos, sneak around the map, and eliminate players without getting caught. After a dead body is reported or an emergency meeting is called, players discuss and vote someone out — whether innocent or guilty.</p><p>The game supports text chat, quick chat, cross-play, friends lists, private lobbies, and new roles such as the Scientist, Engineer, Shapeshifter, and Guardian Angel. Each map — The Skeld, Mira HQ, Polus, and The Airship — offers unique tasks, layouts, and hiding opportunities, making every match different.</p>",

  "story": "<p>Among Us doesn’t follow a traditional story but takes place in a sci-fi universe where Crewmates perform missions across different maps. The lore is built through small hints in tasks, visuals, and official animations created by Innersloth. Characters are quirky astronauts working for The Crew Corporation, but their missions are frequently sabotaged by alien-like shapeshifting Impostors. While the game focuses on gameplay rather than narrative, its universe has expanded through fan theories, comics, collaborations, and official videos.</p>",
