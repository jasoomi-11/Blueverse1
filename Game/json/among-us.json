  "subtitle": "A chaotic spaceship adventure where trust is optional, deception is mandatory, and accusing your best friend is basically a cardio workout. 🚀👀",

  "about": "<p>Among Us Mobile throws you into a spaceship (or creepy planetary base) with 4–15 players, where someone is definitely sus. Your job? Finish your tasks if you’re a Crewmate, or quietly sabotage everything if you’re an Impostor. The charm is in the chaos: emergency meetings, frantic finger-pointing, and the occasional betrayal that leaves everyone yelling in chat. 🛠️💥</p><p>The game thrives on simple, lightweight mechanics: smooth touch controls, fast matchmaking, and quirky animations. Frequent updates keep things fresh, with new maps, cosmetic skins, fun roles like Engineer or Shapeshifter, and random events that make every round unpredictable.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>Each match is a mini drama. Crewmates scramble to finish tasks while Impostors create confusion and eliminate players without getting caught. Dead bodies spark frantic meetings where alliances form, fingers are pointed, and trust evaporates faster than a Medbay scan. With crossplay, private rooms, and quick matches, every game is a hilarious test of social strategy.</p><p>Maps like The Skeld, Mira HQ, Polus, and The Airship each offer unique layouts, secret nooks, and fun task combos. New roles like Guardian Angel let you save players, while Shapeshifter keeps everyone guessing — including you.</p>",

  "story": "<p>There isn’t a heavy narrative, but Among Us has its own quirky lore. Crewmates work for the mysterious Crew Corporation, while alien-like Impostors sneak around and cause chaos. Lore pops up in subtle ways — hints in tasks, map designs, and animations. The community fills in the gaps with fan theories, memes, and hilarious backstories. Basically, the story is what you make of it… usually accusing your friends. 👽🎭</p>",
