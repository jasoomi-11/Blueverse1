  "about": "<p>LifeAfter is a post-apocalyptic survival MMORPG by NetEase where players fight to stay alive after a deadly virus outbreak has turned cities into infected zones. You start as a survivor with nothing but basic supplies, slowly building shelter, scavenging resources, crafting tools, hunting animals, exploring massive maps, teaming with friends, and battling mutated creatures.</p><p>The game mixes survival realism with MMORPG depth — hunger, temperature, infection levels, and weather affect gameplay, while crafting, base-building, combat, and trading form the core mechanics. LifeAfter is known for its intense PvE story missions, dynamic open-world events, and optional PvP zones like Farstar City.</p><p>With regular updates, new maps, seasonal chapters, and improved graphics, LifeAfter has become one of the most polished zombie survival games on Android, iOS, and PC.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>LifeAfter revolves around survival gameplay where players gather materials, build weapons, upgrade bases, and explore large maps filled with enemies and hidden loot. The world constantly pushes players with challenges like cold weather, hunger, nighttime threats, and infected creatures.</p><p>The game offers both solo and co-op experiences, with missions, story chapters, daily operations, and clan wars. Advanced areas like Mount Snow, Levin City, and Mouth Swamp contain tougher enemies and rare materials. PvP lovers can enter War Zones to fight other players for loot and dominance.</p><p>The progression system allows players to upgrade combat level, crafting level, tools, armor, drones, pets, vehicles, and base tech — giving deep long-term growth.</p>",

  "story": "<p>LifeAfter is set in a world ruined by a global viral outbreak that turned most of humanity into infected monsters. As one of the remaining survivors, you wake up after escaping a deadly attack and join a camp of resistance fighters. From there, you uncover the truth behind the virus, fight back infected waves, and help rebuild humanity’s last shelters.</p><p>The story takes you across abandoned cities, frozen mountains, poisonous swamps, deserts, and high-tech research facilities. Along the way, you meet factions with different intentions — some help humanity, others want power, and some secretly work on experiments linked to the infection.</p>",
