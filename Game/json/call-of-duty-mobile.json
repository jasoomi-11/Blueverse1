  "about": "<p>Call of Duty: Mobile (CODM) is not just a mobile shooter — it’s a full Call of Duty experience rebuilt for touchscreens without losing its soul 🔥. Developed by TiMi Studio Group and published by Activision, CODM delivers iconic maps, realistic gunplay, competitive ranked modes, and a massive battle royale, all optimized for mobile devices.</p><p>What makes CODM stand out is how polished everything feels. Weapons have real weight, recoil patterns matter, attachments actually change performance, and movement feels smooth and responsive. Whether you're rushing with an SMG, holding angles with an AR, or quick-scoping with a sniper, the gunplay rewards skill and practice — not random luck.</p><p>Multiplayer is packed with legendary maps like Nuketown, Raid, Standoff, Hijacked, Terminal, Rust, and Crossfire. Each map demands different strategies, positioning, and loadouts. Some favor fast reflexes and close combat, while others reward patience and long-range precision.</p><p>The Battle Royale mode offers a slower but more tactical experience. Large open maps, vehicles, armor systems, revive mechanics, and unique class abilities add depth beyond simple shooting. Choosing the right BR class — like Ninja for movement, Medic for survival, or Scout for tracking — can decide whether you win or spectate 😅.</p><p>CODM constantly evolves through seasonal updates, adding new weapons, operators, modes, ranked changes, and limited-time events. From casual players to hardcore grinders chasing Legendary rank or Damascus camo, the game offers something for everyone.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>Call of Duty: Mobile blends fast-paced multiplayer matches with large-scale battle royale survival. Multiplayer games usually last 4–7 minutes and focus on quick reactions, aim accuracy, movement, and map control.</p><p>Battle Royale matches are longer and more strategic, emphasizing positioning, rotations, loot management, class abilities, and team coordination. Smart decisions often matter more than raw aim.</p><p>The loadout system allows deep customization. Players can fine-tune weapons with attachments, perks, operator skills, and equipment to match aggressive, defensive, or tactical playstyles. No two players are forced to play the same way — unless they copy YouTube loadouts 😄.</p>",

  "story": "<p>COD Mobile doesn’t follow a traditional campaign but exists in a shared universe inspired by Modern Warfare, Black Ops, and Warzone. Seasonal comics and cinematic intros slowly expand the storyline.</p><p>Iconic operators like Ghost, Price, Soap, Adler, Wraith, Nikto, Templar, and Outrider appear across seasons, often clashing in global conflicts involving Task Force 141, Atlas Corporation, Five Knights, and rogue factions.</p><p>The story adds flavor rather than forcing narrative, giving players context without interrupting the action — because let’s be honest, we’re here to shoot first 😎.</p>",
