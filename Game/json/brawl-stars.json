  "about": "<p>Brawl Stars is one of the most energetic and addictive mobile games ever created by Supercell. Designed for quick matches, intense action, and endless replayability, the game throws players into fast 3v3 battles, solo survival modes, and special events that constantly change the way you play.</p><p>Each match lasts only a few minutes, but every second is packed with strategy, movement, aiming skill, and teamwork. Whether you're dodging shots, controlling objectives, or chasing that last enemy in Showdown, Brawl Stars keeps your adrenaline high at all times.</p><p>The heart of the game lies in its unique characters called Brawlers. Every Brawler has a distinct personality, attack style, Super ability, Gadgets, and Star Powers. Some rush head-first into battle, some control areas from afar, and others support teammates — choosing the right Brawler can completely change the outcome of a match.</p><p>With constant updates, new Brawlers, seasonal content, and competitive ranked play, Brawl Stars never feels old. It’s easy to learn, hard to master, and always fun — whether you're playing casually or grinding trophies like a pro.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>Brawl Stars focuses on short, action-heavy matches that reward quick thinking and teamwork. Controls are simple, but mastering movement, aiming, and Super timing separates average players from true legends.</p><p>The game features multiple modes like Gem Grab, Brawl Ball, Heist, Showdown, and Knockout — each with different objectives and strategies. Maps rotate daily, keeping gameplay fresh and forcing players to adapt instead of relying on one trick.</p><p>Progression revolves around unlocking Brawlers, upgrading them with Power Points, unlocking Gadgets and Star Powers, and climbing the Trophy Road. The higher you climb, the tougher (and smarter 😏) your opponents become.</p>",

  "story": "<p>Brawl Stars doesn’t follow a traditional story mode, but each Brawler has their own lore, personality, and theme — from heroic protectors to sneaky troublemakers and chaotic wildcards.</p><p>The world of Brawl Stars feels like a cartoon action universe where anything can happen. Animated shorts, voice lines, seasonal themes, and hidden lore clues add depth and humor, making every Brawler feel alive rather than just another character.</p>",
