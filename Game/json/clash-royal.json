  "about": "<p>Clash Royale is Supercell’s award-winning, real-time strategy and card-based multiplayer game that blends tower defense, MOBA-style gameplay, and tactical deck building. Every match places two players in fast-paced 1v1 or 2v2 battles where smart elixir management, precise troop placement, and counter-strategies decide victory.</p><p>The game features hundreds of cards including troops, buildings, and spells — from the powerful Mega Knight and Royal Giant to the strategic Miner and Goblin Barrel. Each card can be upgraded to improve hitpoints, damage, and utility. With balanced gameplay, seasonal updates, and global esports tournaments, Clash Royale continues to dominate the competitive mobile strategy scene.</p><p>Arena progression takes players from Goblin Stadium all the way to the legendary arenas, unlocking new cards, star levels, champions, banners, emotes, chests, and game mechanics. Daily tasks, seasons, trophy pushing, ranked leagues, Magic Items, and Clan Wars 2.0 give players long-term progression and constant rewards.</p><p>Clash Royale is famous for its quick battles — each match lasts 3 minutes (or longer in overtime). The game rewards creativity, timing, and strategic decision-making rather than just fast tapping. With millions of active players worldwide and frequent balance patches, Clash Royale delivers an ever-evolving competitive experience.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>Clash Royale’s core gameplay revolves around constructing an 8-card battle deck that synergizes with your playstyle. Players must manage a constant elixir flow to deploy troops, counter enemy units, and destroy opponent towers. Crown Towers help defend but must also be protected through smart positioning.</p><p>The game features multiple arenas with unique themes and unlock rewards. Players rise through leagues by earning trophies, while seasonal resets keep competition intense. With tower damage rebalancing, champions, and rotation-based card cycles, every match feels dynamic and strategically rich.</p><p>Both solo and team-based modes allow players to enjoy competitive play, casual matches, practice battles, and special events.</p>",

  "story": "<p>Clash Royale does not follow a traditional story but exists in the shared universe of Supercell’s Clash franchise. Characters like the Archer Queen, Barbarian King, Royal Ghost, and Hog Rider originate from Clash of Clans, bringing their personalities and lore into the arena. The world revolves around clans competing in friendly battles, clan wars, and seasonal events.</p><p>While there is no linear narrative, players uncover character identities and relationships through card descriptions, animations, arena themes, and event updates.</p>",
