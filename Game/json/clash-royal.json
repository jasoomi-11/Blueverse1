  "about": "<p>Clash Royale is Supercell’s iconic real-time strategy card game that turns quick thinking and smart decisions into instant victory or painful defeat (sometimes in the last second 😅). The game mixes tower defense, MOBA-style lane control, and collectible card mechanics into intense 1v1 and 2v2 battles that last just a few minutes.</p><p>Players build an 8-card deck using troops, spells, and buildings, then manage elixir in real time to attack enemy towers and defend their own. From heavy hitters like Mega Knight and P.E.K.K.A to sneaky cards like Miner, Goblin Barrel, and Skeletons, every card has a purpose — and every mistake is punished.</p><p>Arena progression keeps things exciting. As players climb from Goblin Stadium to legendary arenas, they unlock new cards, champions, banners, emotes, star levels, and ranked leagues. Regular seasons, balance changes, Magic Items, and Clan Wars 2.0 ensure the meta never stays the same for too long.</p><p>Clash Royale is famous for its fast matches — 3 minutes of regulation followed by intense overtime where one wrong move can cost the game. Skill, timing, and prediction matter more than speed, making it one of the most competitive strategy games on mobile.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>The core of Clash Royale is deck-building strategy. Each deck contains eight cards that must work together smoothly. Players manage elixir flow, rotate cards efficiently, and place troops carefully to counter enemy pushes while building their own offense.</p><p>Different arenas introduce new cards and mechanics, pushing players to adapt constantly. Trophy Road and the Path of Legends offer ranked progression, while seasonal resets keep competition fresh and challenging.</p><p>Whether playing solo ladder, teaming up in 2v2, or fighting clan battles, Clash Royale offers both casual fun and serious competitive depth.</p>",

  "story": "<p>Clash Royale doesn’t follow a single storyline but exists in the shared Clash universe. Familiar faces from Clash of Clans — like the Barbarian King, Archer Queen, Hog Rider, and Royal Ghost — enter the arena with big personalities and even bigger emotes.</p><p>Each arena has its own theme, atmosphere, and visual storytelling. Card descriptions, animations, and seasonal events quietly expand the lore, giving life to the world without slowing down the action.</p>",
