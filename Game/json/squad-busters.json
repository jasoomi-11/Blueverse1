  "about": "<p>Squad Busters is Supercell’s wildest experiment yet — a colorful, chaotic, and surprisingly strategic squad-based action game that combines characters from Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, Boom Beach, and Brawl Stars into one fast-paced experience. Instead of controlling one hero, you build a <strong>squad</strong> during the match by opening chests, merging characters, and adapting to randomness.</p><p>Each match drops players into a small map filled with monsters, events, and other squads. The goal is simple but stressful 😅: <strong>collect gems, survive encounters, and outplay other players</strong>. But here’s the twist — when your squad gets wiped, you lose everything. Yes… EVERYTHING 💀.</p><p>The game shines in its unpredictability. You never start with the same squad twice. Sometimes you get a powerful tank early, sometimes you’re stuck with weak units and vibes only. This randomness keeps matches fresh and forces players to think fast, take risks, or play safe depending on the situation.</p><p>Squad Busters is easy to pick up, hard to master. Casual players can enjoy quick matches and funny moments, while competitive players will learn squad synergies, fusion timing, map control, and risk management. It’s less about perfect aim and more about smart decisions under pressure.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>Each match lasts around 4 to 6 minutes and features multiple players competing on the same map. Players start solo and gradually build their squad by opening chests, defeating monsters, and fusing identical characters into stronger versions.</p><p>The game focuses heavily on positioning, timing, and knowing when to fight or run. Aggressive play can give big rewards, but one bad fight can instantly end your run. Squad Busters rewards smart rotations, map awareness, and patience — sometimes the best fight is the one you avoid 😎.</p>",

  "story": "<p>Squad Busters doesn’t follow a deep narrative but lives inside the Supercell multiverse. Characters from different games come together in chaotic arenas, driven by pure competition, greed for gems, and questionable teamwork.</p><p>The fun comes from seeing familiar heroes interact in unexpected ways — like a Barbarian fighting alongside a Witch, or a Hog Rider running into total chaos. The story is light, silly, and focused on gameplay rather than lore.</p>",
