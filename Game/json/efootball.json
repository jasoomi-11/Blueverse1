  "subtitle": "A free-to-play football simulator where skills matter, lag hurts, goals feel earned, and every season keeps the game fresh — powered by Unreal Engine magic ✨",

  "developer": "Konami",
  "releaseYear": "2022",
  "genre": "Football Simulation / Sports",

  "about": "<p>eFootball 2025 is Konami’s ever-evolving football simulation that focuses on realism, fair competition, and pure gameplay skill ⚽. Instead of selling a new game every year, Konami updates eFootball season by season with improved physics, smarter AI, better animations, and fresh content. Whether you're a casual mobile player or a sweaty online grinder, eFootball 2025 gives you authentic football without asking for your wallet first 💸.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>eFootball 2025 runs on a live-service model, meaning the game never stands still 🔄. New seasons bring gameplay balance updates, player rating changes, special events, and real-world football tie-ins. Dribbling feels more natural, passing rewards good vision, and defending actually requires thinking (sorry, button spammers 😄). Dream Team mode is the heart of the game, letting you build, upgrade, and fine-tune squads to compete globally.</p>",

  "story": "<p>There’s no cinematic story here — because <strong>football writes its own drama</strong> 📖. Each season is a new chapter where your squad evolves, tactics change, and yesterday’s meta might stop working today. From grinding divisions to winning clutch matches in events, your journey mirrors real football: form matters, confidence shifts, and legends are built one match at a time 🏆.</p>",
