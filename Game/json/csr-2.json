  "about": "<p>CSR Racing 2 is one of the most visually impressive racing games ever released on mobile 📱. Instead of traditional circuit racing, the game focuses on high-intensity drag races where timing is everything ⏱️. Nail the launch, hit perfect shifts, time your nitrous boost, and you’ll fly past your opponent — mess it up, and even a slower car will embarrass you 😅.</p><p>The game features officially licensed cars from legendary manufacturers like Ferrari, Lamborghini, Bugatti, McLaren, and Porsche 🚗. Every car looks insanely realistic, from reflections on the paint to detailed interiors. CSR2 isn’t just about racing — it’s about collecting, upgrading, tuning, and showing off your dream garage.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>CSR Racing 2 delivers short but intense drag races 🏁 designed perfectly for mobile play sessions. Races last only a few seconds, but the progression keeps you hooked for hours. You earn cash 💰, keys 🔑, and reputation points by beating opponents, completing events, and dominating live multiplayer races.</p><p>The game includes a deep upgrade and tuning system 🛠️. Upgrading engine parts, tires, turbo, nitrous, and transmission directly impacts performance. Tuning allows fine control over acceleration, top speed, and grip, rewarding players who understand their car rather than blindly upgrading everything.</p>",

  "story": "<p>CSR Racing 2 places you in the role of an ambitious street racer climbing the underground drag racing scene 🏎️. You face multiple racing crews, each led by a powerful boss who won’t hand over their car without a fight 👑.</p><p>Defeat crew leaders, prove your timing skills, and win their cars as trophies. The story keeps things simple but effective — every boss race feels tense, and every victory feels well-earned.</p>",
