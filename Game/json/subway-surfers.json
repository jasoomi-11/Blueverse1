  "about": "<p>Subway Surfers is one of the most iconic mobile games ever made — fast, flashy, and incredibly addicting ⚡. You play as Jake (or other unlockable characters) as you race through vibrant subway cities 🌍. The goal? Run as far as possible while escaping the Inspector and his dog 👮‍♂️🐕. But of course, it’s not just running — you’ll hoverboard 🛹, jump 🆙, roll, collect coins 💰, complete missions 📜, unlock characters, and enjoy a never-ending world tour of new cities.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>With simple swipe-based controls 👆, Subway Surfers is easy for beginners but surprisingly challenging for high scorers 🏆. Every run is unique — obstacles spawn randomly, power-ups appear in new patterns ⚡, and trains keep you alert. Weekly events 📅, seasonal updates 🎉, and global leaderboards 🌐 make the game fresh even after years. Whether you're chasing high scores or unlocking rare characters, there’s always something fun waiting.</p>",

  "story": "<p>No deep story — Jake and his friends are graffiti artists 🎨 who get caught spraying trains and must run for their lives! The Inspector and his dog chase you across tracks, tunnels, and rooftops 🏃‍♂️💨. It’s simple: run fast, dodge obstacles, grab coins 💰, and don’t get caught!</p>",
