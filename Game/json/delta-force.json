  "about": "<p><strong>Delta Force Mobile</strong> brings classic military shooter DNA to modern mobile gaming — and it does it without dumbing things down. This isn’t a run-and-gun arcade shooter; it’s about positioning, timing, teamwork, and not peeking the same corner twice (trust us 😅).</p><p>The game features realistic gunplay with proper recoil patterns, tactical movement like leaning and crouching, and maps designed to reward smart decision-making. Whether you’re defending an objective or pushing with your squad, every move matters. 🪖</p><p>Best part? It’s surprisingly well-optimized. Mid-range phones can enjoy smooth firefights without turning into pocket heaters 🔥📱. Tactical gameplay, minus the frustration.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>Matches in Delta Force Mobile usually last between <strong>10–15 minutes</strong>, making it perfect for quick sessions or full-on grind marathons. You’ll fight across urban cities, abandoned military bases, forests, deserts, and industrial zones — each designed with flanking routes, vertical combat, and cover-based gameplay.</p><p>The game heavily rewards <strong>squad coordination</strong>. Lone-wolf players can still survive, but coordinated squads dominate objectives, control high ground, and snowball matches. Helicopter drops, supply crates, and rotating zones keep every match unpredictable. 🚁💣</p>",

  "story": "<p>There’s no forced campaign here, but Delta Force Mobile still packs solid lore. You’re part of an elite multinational task force deployed to neutralize global threats — rogue factions, mercenary armies, and experimental weapons gone wrong 🌍.</p><p>Seasonal updates expand the universe with new factions, elite operators, weapons, and sometimes… questionable cosmetics (gold armor, banana helmets — war is weird 🍌).</p>",
