  "about": "<p><strong>Dream League Soccer 2026 (DLS 2026)</strong> takes mobile football to a more tactical, polished, and realistic level. Built for players who want more than arcade-style button mashing, DLS 2026 focuses on intelligent gameplay, smooth animations, and meaningful club management. Every pass, tackle, and shot now feels more deliberate, responsive, and rewarding.</p><p>This edition introduces noticeably improved ball physics, smarter off-ball movement, refined dribbling transitions, and more reliable defensive controls. AI-controlled teammates make better runs, defenders hold their shape more realistically, and goalkeepers react faster to close-range shots. In short — fewer rage moments, more football logic 😄.</p><p>DLS 2026 also shines in its club-building depth. From signing FIFPRO-licensed superstars to upgrading training facilities and stadium capacity, your progress feels earned. Whether you're grinding Career Mode offline or testing your skills in Dream League Live, the game respects skill, tactics, and patience.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>DLS 2026 gives players full control over every aspect of their football club. You can customize kits, logos, formations, player roles, and tactical instructions before stepping onto the pitch. The updated match engine ensures smoother gameplay with better player responsiveness and more natural animations.</p><p>Passing accuracy, shot trajectory, and ball spin now reflect real-world physics more closely. Defensive play rewards good timing instead of random button presses, while attacking feels fluid thanks to improved dribble control and skill execution.</p><p>Progression is balanced around skill-based play. Coins and gems are earned through matches, objectives, and events, allowing you to upgrade facilities, sign better players, and unlock advanced tactics without forcing pay-to-win mechanics.</p>",

  "story": "<p>Rather than following a scripted narrative, DLS 2026 lets you create your own football story. You start as a small club fighting for recognition and slowly climb through divisions to become a global powerhouse.</p><p>Each season introduces new objectives, tougher rivals, transfer opportunities, and breakthrough players. Dynamic commentary, crowd reactions, and cinematic match moments make your club’s rise feel personal — because this is <em>your</em> team, not a preset storyline.</p>",
