  "about": "<p>Clash of Clans is not just a game — it’s a long-term strategy journey that rewards patience, planning, and smart decision-making. Developed by Supercell, this legendary title lets players design powerful villages, train diverse armies, unlock heroes, and battle millions of players worldwide in real-time PvP combat.</p><p>The heart of Clash of Clans lies in progression. Gold, Elixir, and Dark Elixir must be managed carefully to upgrade defenses, strengthen troops, and level up heroes. Iconic heroes like the Barbarian King, Archer Queen, Grand Warden, Royal Champion, and Battle Machine bring personality and tactical depth, often deciding the outcome of battles (and yes, Queen Walks still rule 👑).</p><p>From casual farming to intense Clan War Leagues, the game offers something for everyone. Regular updates, balance changes, and new features ensure that Clash of Clans never feels outdated, even after more than a decade of dominance.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>Clash of Clans revolves around two main goals: build an unbreakable village and destroy enemy bases for loot and trophies. Every upgrade matters — from walls and defenses to troop levels and hero abilities. Advancing your Town Hall unlocks new mechanics, stronger units, siege machines, and deeper strategic options.</p><p>The Home Village focuses on traditional attacks, clan wars, farming, and trophy pushing, while the Builder Base introduces real-time versus battles and unique troops. Builder Base 2.0 adds faster pacing, better rewards, and more strategic depth, making it more than just a side mode.</p><p>Clan activities play a huge role. Clan Wars, Clan War Leagues, and Clan Games encourage teamwork, coordination, and smart planning. Seasonal events, Gold Pass rewards, magic items, and hero equipment keep progression exciting and rewarding.</p>",

  "story": "<p>Clash of Clans doesn’t tell a single fixed story, but it lives in a fantasy world filled with brave warriors, powerful magic, and endless rivalries. Barbarians charge fearlessly, Wizards rain fireballs, Dragons dominate the skies, and heroes stand as legends of the battlefield.</p><p>The Home Village represents your growing kingdom, while the Builder Base hints at mysterious engineering and ancient inventions led by the Master Builder. Through new troops, skins, sceneries, and events, Supercell subtly expands the lore without ever slowing down gameplay.</p>",
