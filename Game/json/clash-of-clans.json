  "about": "<p>Clash of Clans is one of the world’s most successful strategy games, combining base-building, real-time battles, hero upgrades, clan wars, and long-term progression into one addictive package. Developed by Supercell, the game lets players build and upgrade their village, train troops, unlock heroes, and battle opponents in PvP and PvE modes.</p><p>Players must manage gold, elixir, and dark elixir to strengthen defenses, unlock new troops, and improve their attacking power. Heroes like the Barbarian King, Archer Queen, Grand Warden, Royal Champion, and Battle Machine add depth, each with abilities that change attack strategies. With Clan Wars, Clan War Leagues, Clan Games, challenges, events, and Builder Base 2.0, Clash of Clans offers constant updates, balanced gameplay, and competitive action.</p><p>The game rewards strategy, planning, and teamwork. Whether you're a casual player building slowly or a competitive player grinding trophies and leagues, the game offers endless progression through Town Hall levels, new troops, new defenses, and new mechanics added yearly.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>Clash of Clans centers around building your home village, defending it from raids, and launching your own attacks to gain loot. Every building, troop, and hero is part of your long-term strategy. Upgrading your Town Hall unlocks new layers of gameplay, including advanced defenses, new troops, siege machines, and hero abilities.</p><p>The game features two major modes: the Home Village and the Builder Base. Home Village focuses on strategic attacks, clan wars, farming, and trophy pushing. Builder Base (including Builder Base 2.0) offers real-time versus battles, unique troops, and powerful mechanics like the Battle Machine and Mega Mini.</p><p>Players can also join clans, participate in Clan Wars, Clan Games, and CWL (Clan War Leagues), and compete in monthly events. Supercell regularly adds new challenges, skins, magic items, hero equipment, and seasonal rewards to keep the experience fresh and competitive.</p>",

  "story": "<p>Clash of Clans doesn't follow a linear story but takes place in a fantasy world filled with warriors, wizards, giants, dragons, and heroes. The lore suggests a world of magical forces, ancient kingdoms, and legendary warriors competing for resources and territory.</p><p>The Home Village represents your growing kingdom, while the Builder Base reveals a mysterious island ruled by Master Builder, who crafts unique inventions. As Supercell releases new troops, heroes, and gameplay features, the world expands with subtle storytelling through events, challenges, and character designs.</p>",
