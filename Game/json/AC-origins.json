  "about": "<p>Assassin’s Creed Origins takes you back to where it all began 📜. Set in Ancient Egypt, the game follows Bayek of Siwa, a Medjay whose duty to protect the people slowly turns into a much larger mission. From golden deserts and towering pyramids to lively cities along the Nile, Origins blends history, mystery, and RPG combat into a world that feels alive, dangerous, and endlessly explorable.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>With Origins, the Assassin’s Creed series reinvented itself as a full RPG ⚔️. Players can explore Egypt freely, take on quests in any order, level up Bayek, and customize weapons and gear. Combat is more tactical, enemies have levels, and exploration rewards curiosity. Whether you're hunting animals, looting ancient tombs, or getting distracted by side quests (again), the game constantly pulls you into its world.</p>",

  "story": "<p>The story centers on Bayek, one of the last Medjays, whose personal tragedy pushes him into a fight against a secret order controlling Egypt from the shadows 🐍. Alongside Aya, his journey uncovers political schemes, royal betrayals, and ancient conspiracies. This emotional narrative lays the foundation for the Assassin Brotherhood and explains why the Creed exists in the first place.</p>",
