  "genre": "Action RPG / Soulslike / Gothic Horror",

  "about": "<p>Bloodborne is a dark, thrilling action-RPG that pushes your reflexes and courage to the limit. You play as a Hunter roaming the cursed city of Yharnam, where a mysterious blood-borne illness has turned citizens into horrific beasts. Every street, alley, and cathedral hides danger — and sometimes, a story fragment that will make you go 'Whoa, what?!' 🩸🕯️</p><p>The game encourages aggressive combat over defense: dodge, parry, and strike with visceral precision. Trick Weapons transform mid-battle, keeping fights unpredictable. Exploration is rewarded — secret paths, hidden bosses, and eerie environments make each playthrough unique. Bloodborne isn’t just a game; it’s a gothic adventure dripping with tension, atmosphere, and occasional panic screams.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>Bloodborne blends fast-paced melee combat, terrifying enemies, and mysterious lore into an unforgettable gothic experience. Trick Weapons allow you to swap between two modes mid-combat, changing speed, reach, and attack style. Firearms aren’t for damage but for parries, opening up devastating Visceral Attacks. 🗡️💥</p><p>The city of Yharnam is a maze of interconnected streets, alleys, and hidden dungeons. Enemies range from plague-ridden humans to nightmarish eldritch horrors. Chalice Dungeons offer randomized challenges and loot, keeping gameplay fresh and punishing even veteran Hunters. Whether you’re exploring, fighting, or uncovering lore, Bloodborne rewards curiosity and patience… and maybe a scream or two.</p>",

  "story": "<p>You are a nameless Hunter entering Yharnam on the infamous Night of the Hunt. What starts as a mission to cure a mysterious blood disease quickly descends into nightmare as you uncover the secrets of the Healing Church, forbidden rituals, and cosmic entities called the Great Ones. 🦇</p><p>The narrative is told subtly — through item descriptions, NPC dialogue, and the environment itself — encouraging players to piece together the story like a grim, gothic puzzle. Dreams, reality, and nightmares blur, making every step feel tense, eerie, and totally thrilling.</p>",
