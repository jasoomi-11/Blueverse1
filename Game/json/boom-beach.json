  "about": "<p><strong>Boom Beach</strong> is Supercell’s tactical strategy game that blends base-building with real-time attacks in a tropical warzone 🏝️💥. Unlike fast-click games, Boom Beach rewards patience, planning, and intelligent troop deployment. Every battle feels like a puzzle — attack smart, or retreat in shame.</p><p>You command a growing island base while launching attacks against enemy strongholds controlled by the evil <strong>Blackguard</strong>. The goal isn’t just destruction — it’s domination through strategy, upgrades, and perfect timing ⏱️.</p><p>What makes Boom Beach special is its focus on offense-first gameplay. Instead of endless defense waiting, the game pushes players to attack, experiment with troop combinations, and learn from every mistake (yes, even the painful ones 😅).</p>",

  "overview": "<p>In Boom Beach, players build and upgrade their headquarters, defenses, statues, and troops while exploring a massive ocean map filled with enemy bases, resource islands, and special events 🌊.</p><p>Each attack is launched from landing crafts, where troops march toward enemy defenses based on player commands. You control the battlefield using <strong>Gunboat Energy</strong> to deploy artillery, flares, shocks, and hero abilities.</p><p>The game emphasizes tactical decision-making — wrong landing spot? Troops wiped. Bad timing? Base survives. Perfect execution? Total destruction 💣.</p>",

  "story": "<p>Boom Beach takes place in a vibrant tropical archipelago ruled by the ruthless <strong>Blackguard</strong>, an army obsessed with power and control 🧨.</p><p>You play as the commander of a resistance force, freeing islands, rescuing villagers, and uncovering secrets hidden beneath ancient statues and mysterious power stones 🗿.</p><p>As you progress, the conflict expands through Task Forces, Warships, and Operations — turning the fight into a full-scale island war.</p>",
