  "overview": "<p>Every Wild Rift match is a 5v5 battle where teams fight across three lanes—Baron Lane, Mid Lane, and Dragon Lane—supported by a jungle filled with monsters, buffs, and objectives. Players gain gold, purchase items, level up abilities, and coordinate team fights to gain map control.</p><p>The map features key objectives such as Elemental Dragons, Rift Herald, and Baron Nashor that provide huge advantages when secured. With fast match times (15–20 minutes), Wild Rift is designed for mobile-friendly competitive play without sacrificing depth or strategy.</p>",

  "story": "<p>Wild Rift does not follow a single linear storyline but takes place within the vast League of Legends universe, featuring champions from diverse regions such as Demacia, Noxus, Ionia, Piltover, Zaun, Freljord, and the Shadow Isles. Each champion has lore, personality, and a unique backstory that connects to the larger world of Runeterra.</p><p>The game frequently releases events that explore Runeterra’s history, magical conflicts, powerful factions, and legendary heroes, allowing players to experience narrative-driven gameplay through cinematics, missions, and themed rewards.</p>",
