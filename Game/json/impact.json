  "about": "<p>Genshin Impact is a massive open-world action RPG that blends exploration, elemental combat and a rich character-driven experience. Built with a global audience in mind, the game offers a living world that rewards curiosity, experimentation and team-building strategy. From its anime-inspired art style to its polished world design, Genshin Impact stands out as one of the most successful cross-platform free-to-play titles ever released.</p><p>The game’s world, Teyvat, is divided into multiple nations—each inspired by real-world cultures and powered by a unique elemental philosophy. Players travel through these regions as the Traveler, uncovering secrets, solving puzzles, and forming a party of four characters, each with their own abilities and elemental strengths.</p><p>Unlike traditional RPGs, Genshin builds progression around exploration rather than grinding. Every region features hidden chests, world bosses, environmental puzzles, shrines, dungeons and special events. Its elemental reaction system—using Pyro, Hydro, Electro, Cryo, Dendro, Geo and Anemo—creates a deep combat experience that encourages combining abilities for powerful results.</p><p>Whether you play casually for story and exploration, or competitively through meta builds and artifact optimization, Genshin Impact caters to all styles with regular updates, new regions, and seasonal content that keeps the world evolving.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>At its core, Genshin Impact is designed around freedom. Players can climb, swim and glide across enormous landscapes without loading screens. Each region introduces new enemies, traversal mechanics, puzzles and characters that expand gameplay variety. The multi-region design ensures that the game never becomes repetitive, as every environment has its own challenges, culture and world-building details.</p><p>The game is also highly accessible. It runs on PC, PlayStation, mobile devices and even cloud platforms, allowing players to enjoy the same experience across multiple systems with seamless cross-save support. This makes it one of the most flexible and beginner-friendly RPGs available today.</p>",

  "story": "<p>Genshin Impact centers on the Traveler, a mysterious figure searching for their lost sibling across the elemental nations of Teyvat. Each nation has its own Archon, culture and storyline, giving players a mix of character-driven narrative, world lore and adventure. Instead of one continuous plot, the game expands through frequent chapter updates that slowly reveal the deeper mysteries of the world.</p>",
