  "about": "<p>Stardew Valley is a relaxing farming and life simulation adventure where you inherit your grandfather’s old farm in a quiet town called Pelican Town. With overgrown fields and broken buildings, your job is to restore the land, grow crops, raise animals, mine for resources, craft tools, and interact with the quirky townspeople. The game offers a slow-paced, heartwarming experience perfect for players who enjoy creativity, exploration, and calm gameplay.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>You begin with a rundown farm and basic tools, but as seasons change, you grow crops, upgrade buildings, and unlock deeper mechanics such as mining, fishing, cooking, and crafting. Players can socialize with villagers, attend festivals, complete quests, and even get married. Whether you like farming, dungeon-crawling, or building, Stardew Valley gives total freedom to play your own way.</p>",

  "story": "<p>You leave behind your stressful corporate job after receiving a letter from your grandfather, who gifts you a small farm in the peaceful Pelican Town. As you rebuild your land, you slowly connect with the community — each character having their own personality, struggles, and stories. Along the way, you uncover mysteries of the valley, explore mines, discover secrets of the wizard, and face the corporate giant JojaMart that threatens the town’s traditions. Your journey is about creating a life worth living.</p>",
