      "short": "Resident Evil 6 is a large-scale action-horror game featuring four interwoven campaigns with Leon, Chris, Jake, and Ada facing the global C-virus outbreak.",
      "full": "Resident Evil 6 expands the franchise into an action-packed, globe-trotting bio-terror story with four intersecting campaigns. Players experience unique gameplay styles across each campaign — atmospheric survival horror with Leon and Helena, military-style shooter with Chris and Piers, hand-to-hand combat specialization with Jake and Sherry, and stealth-oriented missions with Ada Wong. The C-virus outbreak spans Tall Oaks, Lanshiang, Edonia, and underwater Neo-Umbrella facilities. With intense boss fights, cinematic sequences, character-driven storytelling, and co-op gameplay, RE6 delivers the most ambitious multi-perspective narrative in the series."
