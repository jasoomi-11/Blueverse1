  "about": "<p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB) is one of the world’s most popular mobile MOBA games, built from the ground up for fast 10–15 minute strategic matches. Developed by Moonton Games, MLBB delivers a full esports-grade competitive ecosystem on mobile devices, offering deep hero mastery, tactical team coordination, and objective-focused gameplay.</p><p>The game features 5v5 online battles where two teams compete to destroy each other’s base by controlling lanes, farming gold, defeating objectives, and securing map domination. MLBB’s roster of 120+ heroes offers true variety — tanks, fighters, mages, marksmen, assassins, and supports — each designed with unique skills, combos, power spikes, and battlefield roles. This allows players to build their own identity and master specific playstyles.</p><p>MLBB's core strength is its accessibility. The controls are smooth, matchmaking is fast, and the game is optimized even for mid-range devices. Yet beneath this simplicity lies deep strategy: lane control, rotations, jungle invasion, ambush timing, item builds, counter-picking, crowd-control chaining, and map awareness make MLBB a highly skill-based game.</p><p>With global tournaments like MPL, MSC, and the M-Series World Championship, MLBB stands as one of the biggest esports in the mobile gaming world. New heroes, skins, events, collaborations, and balance patches keep the game fresh for both casual and competitive players.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>Mobile Legends is built around classic MOBA fundamentals: three lanes, jungle monsters, turrets, minions, and a final Nexus/Core objective. Each match begins with players selecting heroes based on team composition — balancing damage, tankiness, mobility, and utility.</p><p>The game rewards strong map awareness, efficient farming, timely rotations, and smart team fights. Compared to longer PC MOBAs, MLBB focuses on faster battles, smooth controls, and shorter match lengths. This makes it ideal for mobile users who want competitive depth without long commitments.</p><p>Players can choose roles such as Gold Lane Marksman, Mid Lane Mage, Jungle Assassin, EXP Lane Fighter, or Roaming Tank/Support. Each role has a unique responsibility — dealing damage, engaging fights, protecting teammates, securing objectives, or controlling map vision.</p>",

  "story": "<p>Mobile Legends does not follow a single linear story but features an expanding universe known as the \"Land of Dawn.\" Each hero belongs to a region, kingdom, or faction with unique lore — including the Moniyan Empire, the Abyss, the Northern Vale, the Oriental Fighters, the Dark Abyss, and several cosmic or futuristic dimensions.</p><p>Heroes like Alucard, Tigreal, Miya, Gusion, Lancelot, Hanabi, Kagura, and Lunox have intertwined storylines involving ancient wars, royal bloodlines, forbidden magic, and cosmic balance. Seasonal events expand the lore by introducing new chapters, cinematic trailers, comic-style storytelling, and character backgrounds.</p>",
