  "about": "<p>Candy Crush Saga is not just a puzzle game — it’s a worldwide habit 😄. Developed by King, this iconic match-3 title has entertained millions of players for over a decade with its bright visuals, clever level design, and incredibly satisfying candy-smashing mechanics. What starts as a simple match-three quickly turns into a brain-teasing experience where every move matters.</p><p>The core idea is easy to learn but hard to master: match candies, clear objectives, and beat the level before you run out of moves. As you progress, the game introduces new blockers, layered obstacles, special candies, and tricky layouts that demand planning rather than luck. This constant evolution keeps the gameplay fresh, even after hundreds (or thousands) of levels.</p><p>One of Candy Crush Saga’s biggest strengths is its accessibility. Anyone can play it — kids, adults, casual players, or hardcore puzzle fans. You can enjoy a quick level during a break or get lost in a long puzzle-solving session. With frequent updates, events, and new episodes, Candy Crush continues to feel alive years after its launch.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>Each level in Candy Crush Saga offers a unique objective — clearing jelly, collecting ingredients, breaking blockers, or reaching a score target. Matching more than three candies creates powerful special candies like striped, wrapped, and color bombs that can completely flip the board in your favor.</p><p>Combining special candies is where the real magic happens. These combos trigger massive chain reactions that clear large sections of the board and feel incredibly rewarding. Boosters like Lollipop Hammers and Jelly Fish act as your emergency tools when levels get stubborn (and yes, some levels really are stubborn 😅).</p><p>The difficulty curve is well-balanced. Early levels help you relax, while later stages challenge your patience, strategy, and ability to think several moves ahead. Weekly level updates and rotating events ensure there’s always something new to tackle.</p>",

  "story": "<p>Candy Crush Saga doesn’t rely on a deep storyline, but it takes place in the cheerful Candy Kingdom. Players travel alongside cute characters like Tiffi through dessert-themed worlds filled with chocolate mountains, jelly forests, and sugary towns. Each episode adds personality and charm without ever getting in the way of gameplay.</p>",
