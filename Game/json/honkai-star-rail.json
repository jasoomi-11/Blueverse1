  "about": "<p>Honkai: Star Rail is a cinematic turn-based space fantasy RPG created by HoYoverse, the studio behind Genshin Impact and Honkai Impact 3rd. The game takes players aboard the Astral Express – a star-traveling train – as they explore vast planets, uncover mysterious civilizations, and face cosmic threats known as Aeons. With its stunning visuals, memorable characters, and deep progression systems, the game has become one of the fastest-growing mobile RPGs worldwide.</p><p>The gameplay combines classic turn-based strategy with HoYoverse’s signature cinematic style. Each battle is smooth, fast-paced, and filled with flashy ultimate animations. Players build a team of four characters, master elemental paths, and exploit enemy weaknesses to win efficiently. Outside of combat, players explore semi-open environments, solve puzzles, interact with NPCs, and complete engaging quests filled with humor, emotion, and lore.</p><p>Honkai: Star Rail is updated frequently with major versions adding new worlds, characters, events, and story chapters. Whether you enjoy deep storytelling, strategic combat, or collecting powerful units, the game offers an ever-expanding universe with endless adventures.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>Honkai: Star Rail revolves around strategic, turn-based combat where each character belongs to a specific Element (like Ice, Lightning, Fire, Quantum) and Path (roles such as Hunt, Destruction, Harmony, Erudition). Players must build balanced teams, break enemy toughness bars, and trigger Weakness Break for bonus effects. The game rewards smart planning, character synergy, and timing.</p><p>Outside combat, players travel across planets such as Jarilo-VI, the Xianzhou Luofu, and Penacony, each featuring open zones filled with secrets, chests, puzzles, and missions. Side quests are written with humor and world-building depth, making exploration rewarding. Regular events offer additional rewards such as characters, Light Cones, and upgrade materials.</p><p>Progression includes character level-ups, traces (skill trees), relic farming, eidolons, and Light Cones. Weekly bosses, simulated universes, and memory challenges test player strategy at higher difficulties.</p>",

  "story": "<p>The game follows the Trailblazer, a mysterious protagonist implanted with a Stellaron — a powerful, dangerous cosmic entity tied to the Aeons. After awakening on the Herta Space Station, the Trailblazer joins the crew of the Astral Express led by the enigmatic conductor Pom-Pom. Together, they journey across planets affected by cosmic disasters, uncovering Stellaron-related mysteries.</p><p>As players progress, they learn about the Aeons — god-like beings shaping the universe’s destiny. Each world introduces new factions, conflicts, and emotional character arcs. The story blends mystery, comedy, philosophical ideas, and heartfelt moments, making it one of HoYoverse’s strongest narratives.</p>",
