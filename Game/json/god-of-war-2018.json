  "subtitle": "A bold reinvention of a legendary series — blending Norse mythology, emotional storytelling, brutal axe combat, and cinematic perfection into one unforgettable PlayStation experience.",
  "trailer": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/K0u_kAWLJOA",

  "developer": "Santa Monica Studio",
  "releaseYear": "2018",
  "genre": "Action Adventure / Story-Driven Combat",

  "about": "<p>God of War (2018) is not just a sequel — it’s a complete rebirth of the franchise 🔥. Moving away from Greek mythology, the game places Kratos in the cold, dangerous world of Norse legends, where monsters are brutal, gods are unpredictable, and parenting is somehow even harder than fighting dragons.</p><p>The story follows Kratos and his son Atreus on a deeply personal journey to fulfill a final promise. Along the way, the game delivers emotional storytelling, unforgettable character moments, and a rare balance between action and heart ❤️. The single-shot camera (no cuts, no loading screens breaking immersion) makes the entire adventure feel like one continuous cinematic experience.</p><p>Combat has been completely redesigned around the Leviathan Axe — a weighty, magical weapon that can be thrown, recalled, and customized with devastating runic attacks. Combined with RPG-style upgrades, exploration, puzzles, and richly detailed environments, God of War (2018) stands as one of the highest-rated and most celebrated console games of all time.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>God of War introduces slower, more tactical combat compared to earlier entries, rewarding precision, positioning, and timing 🧠. The Leviathan Axe, defensive shield mechanics, and Atreus’ support abilities create layered battles where strategy matters more than button-mashing.</p><p>The semi-open world is packed with secrets — hidden paths, ancient puzzles, legendary gear, side quests (called Favors), and optional boss encounters. Players explore lakes, ruins, mountains, and mystical realms, all seamlessly connected without immersion-breaking cuts.</p><p>Optimized for PS4 and enhanced further on PS5, the game delivers smooth performance, stunning lighting, and incredible environmental detail — making every realm feel alive, dangerous, and worth exploring.</p>",

  "story": "<p>After leaving behind the chaos of Greece, Kratos attempts to live a quieter life in the Norse realm with his son, Atreus. Following the death of his wife Faye, the two set out to scatter her ashes from the highest peak in the realms — a journey that quickly becomes far more dangerous than expected.</p><p>As gods, monsters, and ancient forces intervene, Kratos must confront his violent past while teaching Atreus discipline, survival, and control. The father-son relationship evolves naturally throughout the story, delivering emotional weight rarely seen in action games. It’s a tale of loss, growth, responsibility, and fate — told without ever taking control away from the player 🎭.</p>",
