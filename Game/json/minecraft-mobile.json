  "about": "<p>Minecraft Mobile (Bedrock Edition) is the official portable version of the world’s most popular sandbox survival game. Designed for Android and iOS, this edition offers infinite worlds, smoother performance, full cross-play, and an optimized touch-based interface — allowing players to experience the true Minecraft universe anywhere.</p><p>Whether you want to build massive cities, survive deadly nights, experiment with redstone, explore caves, or create custom worlds, Minecraft Mobile provides all the tools you need. With frequent updates, biome expansions, new mobs, and seasonal events, the mobile edition continues to evolve with the same features and mechanics available on modern consoles and Windows 10/11.</p><p>The Bedrock engine ensures stable gameplay, faster loading, higher render distances (depending on device), and access to exclusive content through the Minecraft Marketplace. Players can purchase skins, texture packs, mash-up worlds, and community-made maps while enjoying the full freedom to craft their own adventures.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>Minecraft Mobile allows players to choose between two main gameplay paths: Survival and Creative. In Survival mode, players must gather resources, craft tools, build shelter, and defend themselves from hostile mobs like zombies, skeletons, creepers, and Endermen. Hunger, health, exploration, and combat create a balanced survival experience.</p><p>In Creative mode, all blocks and items are available without restrictions. Players can build anything — from redstone farms to giant pixel art, skyscrapers, automated factories, or detailed medieval kingdoms. Mobile users enjoy smooth touch controls, adjustable UI scaling, and support for external controllers.</p><p>Exploration is core to Minecraft. Players can travel across biomes including deserts, forests, oceans, jungles, snowy mountains, badlands, lush caves, cherry groves, deep dark biomes, the Nether dimension, and the End dimension where the mighty Ender Dragon resides.</p>",

  "story": "<p>Minecraft does not follow a fixed linear storyline. Instead, players create their own progression path through exploration, crafting, mob battles, and personal builds. The closest thing to a main story is the adventure leading to the End dimension, where the Ender Dragon serves as the game’s ultimate boss.</p><p>The world is filled with subtle lore: ancient ruins, portals, villages, strongholds, deep dark cities created by ancient civilizations, and mysterious mobs like Endermen and Wardens. Minecraft’s story is intentionally open-ended — encouraging players to interpret the world and create their own narratives.</p>",
