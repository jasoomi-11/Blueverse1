  "about": "<p>God of War Ragnarök continues the legendary father-son saga in breathtaking Norse realms ❄️🔥. Kratos and Atreus face the coming apocalypse of Ragnarök, confronting gods, monsters, and their own destinies. Built exclusively for PlayStation consoles, this game combines cinematic storytelling, fluid combat, and next-gen visuals to create an unforgettable journey.</p><p>Ragnarök improves everything from the 2018 game: faster and more responsive combat, dual-wielding attacks, elemental weapon infusions, enhanced shield mechanics, and dynamic boss fights. The semi-open worlds are packed with hidden secrets, puzzles, lore, and optional bosses that reward exploration and clever play. On PS5, enjoy 4K resolution, 60FPS, ultra-fast SSD loading, haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers that make every swing of the Leviathan Axe feel satisfying.</p><p>From snow-covered Midgard to volcanic Muspelheim, the realms feel alive — filled with NPCs, collectibles, side quests, and environmental surprises. Expect emotional storytelling that makes you feel both the weight of destiny and the occasional dad-joke-worthy parenting moment 🤦‍♂️.</p>",

  "overview": "<p>God of War Ragnarök delivers an exceptional balance of cinematic storytelling and precise, skill-based combat. Switch between Kratos and Atreus in pivotal moments, each offering unique attacks and gameplay styles. The Leviathan Axe returns with frost-based powers, the Blades of Chaos provide fast, fluid combos, and new shields and weapon abilities expand your strategic options.</p><p>Exploration is richer than ever, with large hub areas, boat and sled traversal, hidden realms, treasure maps, crafting, skill trees, and optional bosses. Environmental puzzles challenge your wits, while combat demands timing, positioning, and mastery of multiple weapon types. PS5 optimization adds realistic lighting, volumetric effects, and immersive 3D audio, making every clash and conversation feel epic.</p>",

  "story": "<p>Ragnarök explores the prophecy of Atreus, destined to become Loki, as father and son face gods, monsters, and a world unraveling during Fimbulwinter. Odin and Thor are relentless, but so is Kratos — and he’s teaching Atreus some questionable parenting skills along the way 😅. The narrative is a rich tapestry of family, destiny, and choice, unfolding dynamically through cinematic cutscenes, environmental storytelling, and dialogue that adapts to your exploration. Expect heart, humor, and high-stakes action.</p>",
