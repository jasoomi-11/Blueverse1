"summary": "After fulfilling a blood oath, legendary hitman John Wick is pulled back into the violent world he tried to leave behind. His forced mission triggers a chain of betrayals, setting him on a collision course with a global network of assassins.",

  "story": "After returning to a quiet life, John Wick is confronted by Santino D’Antonio, who holds a 'marker'—a blood oath that John must honor. Santino commands John to assassinate his sister, Gianna D’Antonio, so he can claim her High Table seat. John travels to Rome and completes the mission, but Santino betrays him, placing a $7 million bounty on his head to cover his tracks. Forced to fight off relentless assassins, John returns to New York to confront Santino. In a desperate act, John kills him inside the Continental—violating the sacred rules of sanctuary. Winston declares John 'excommunicado,' stripping him of all privileges and leaving him hunted by the entire global assassin network.",

  "details": "John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) expands the mythology of the franchise, revealing the High Table, the rules of the Continental, and the global reach of the assassin world. The film is known for its precise gun-fu choreography, world-building, and stylish cinematography. Keanu Reeves performed most of his own stunts, adding realism to the action sequences. The movie deepens the emotional weight of John’s struggle while building the foundations for Chapter 3 and Chapter 4.",
