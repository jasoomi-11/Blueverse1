  "summary": "Immediately after being declared 'excommunicado,’ John Wick becomes the target of a $14 million global bounty. With no sanctuary, no weapons support, and every assassin in the world hunting him, John must fight his way through New York while seeking a path to survival.",
  
  "story": "Following the events of Chapter 2, John Wick is given one hour before the bounty on his head becomes active. Cut off from all Continental privileges, he tries to escape New York while being relentlessly attacked by assassins. John seeks help from the Director of the Ruska Roma, who grants him passage to Morocco. There, he reunites with Sofia, an old ally who owes him a debt. Together they confront Berrada, a High Table elder. John eventually reaches the Elder himself, who offers forgiveness in exchange for John's loyalty and a sacrifice. Returning to New York, John is ordered to kill Winston, but both men eventually refuse to bow to the High Table. A massive showdown erupts at the Continental, ending with the Adjudicator retreating. However, John is betrayed and severely injured, left to plan revenge with the Bowery King against the High Table.",
  
  "details": "John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum (2019) pushes the franchise into its most explosive territory yet, expanding the lore of the High Table, global assassin factions, and the inner mythology behind the Continental. The film is widely praised for its groundbreaking action choreography, including knife-fighting sequences, horse combat, motorcycle sword fights, and the iconic glass room battle. Keanu Reeves underwent extensive training in judo, jiu-jitsu, and weapons handling, performing the majority of his own stunts. Directed by Chad Stahelski, the movie further evolves John Wick into a near-mythic figure while setting the stage for Chapter 4.",
