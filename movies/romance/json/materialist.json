After a sudden breakup shakes her foundation, she crosses paths with a charismatic matchmaker who introduces her to a system based on emotional intelligence rather than wealth or aesthetics.

As their relationship grows, Lucy must confront her own fear of vulnerability and decide whether she is willing to give up the world she knows for something real.",
